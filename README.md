# ishell_reduction

This is an IDL data extraction code in development for the iSHELL camera. It performs flat-field correction, bad pixel masking and trace extraction, and is built to be easily portable to other cross-dispersed instruments. Dark current correction is also possible as an option. This code does not attempt to derive a wavelength solution.

Right now this code has only been tested on K-Short and K-2 band data with iShell.
